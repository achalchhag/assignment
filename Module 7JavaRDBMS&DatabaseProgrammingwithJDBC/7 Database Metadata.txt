7. Database Metadata
Theory:
What is DatabaseMetaData?
DatabaseMetaData is an interface within the JDBC API that provides information about the connected database,
including its capabilities, tables, columns, data types, and other metadata, allowing developers to dynamically 
query and understand the structure of the database they are interacting with without needing to hardcode details about it.

Importance of Database Metadata in JDBC
In JDBC, database metadata is crucial because it provides detailed information about the underlying database structure,
including tables, columns, data types, and supported features, allowing developers to write flexible 
applications that can interact with different databases without needing to hardcode specific details, essentially making their applications more portable and adaptable to various database systems

Methods provided by DatabaseMetaData (getDatabaseProductName, getTables,etc.)
The DatabaseMetaData interface in Java provides a wealth of methods to retrieve information about the underlying database. Here are a few commonly used ones:
getDatabaseProductName(): Retrieves the name of the database product.
getDatabaseProductVersion(): Retrieves the version number of the database product.
getDriverName(): Retrieves the name of the JDBC driver.
getDriverVersion(): Retrieves the version number of the JDBC driver.
getURL(): Retrieves the URL used to connect to the database.
getUserName(): Retrieves the username used to connect to the database.
