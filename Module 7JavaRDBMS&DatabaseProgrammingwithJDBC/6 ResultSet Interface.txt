Theory:
What is ResultSet in JDBC?
A "ResultSet" is a Java object that stores the results of an executed SQL query, essentially acting as a table containing rows and columns of data retrieved from a database,
allowing you to access and iterate through the data returned by a query using a cursor-like mechanism to navigate through each row individually; it's a core component for retrieving data from a database using JDBC.

Navigating through ResultSet (first, last, next, previous)

"next()": This method is used to move the cursor to the next row in the ResultSet and returns true if successful, otherwise false when there are no more rows. 
"first()": Moves the cursor to the first row of the ResultSet. 
"last()": Moves the cursor to the last row of the ResultSet. 
"previous()": Moves the cursor to the previous row in the ResultSet (only available with a scrollable ResultSet). 

Working with ResultSet to retrieve data from SQL queries
The ResultSet interface declares getter methods (for example, getBoolean and getLong ) for retrieving column values from the current row.
You can retrieve values using either the index number of the column or the alias or name of the column. The column index is usually more efficient.
