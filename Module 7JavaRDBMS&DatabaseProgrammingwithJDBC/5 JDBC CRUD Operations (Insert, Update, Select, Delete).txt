5. JDBC CRUD Operations (Insert, Update, Select, Delete)
Theory:
Insert: Adding a new record to the database.
Update: Modifying existing records.
Select: Retrieving recordsfrom the database.
Delete: Removing records from the database.

1. Insert
Concept:
The INSERT statement adds a new row to a specified table in the database.
You provide values for the columns to be inserted.

2. Update
Concept:
The UPDATE statement modifies existing rows in a table.
You specify the columns to be updated and their new values.
A WHERE clause is used to filter the rows to be updated.

3. Select
Concept:
The SELECT statement retrieves data from one or more tables.
You can specify the columns to retrieve and use a WHERE clause to filter the results.

4. Delete
Concept:
The DELETE statement removes rows from a table.
A WHERE clause is essential to specify which rows to delete.
