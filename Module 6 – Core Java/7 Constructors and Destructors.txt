Theory:
Constructor Types (Default, Parameterized)
Default:
A constructor with no parameters.If you don't explicitly define any constructor in a class, 
the Java compiler automatically provides a default constructor.
Parameterized:
A constructor that accepts one or more parameters.

Copy Constructor (Emulated in Java)
A constructor that creates a new object by copying the values from an existing object of the same class

Constructor Overloading
Constructor overloading in Java is a concept where a class has multiple constructors with different parameter lists

Object Life Cycle and Garbage Collection
Object Life Cycle:
The life cycle of an object refers to the stages it goes through from its creation to its eventual destruction.

Garbage Collection:
The Java garbage collector reclaims the memory occupied by inaccessible objects.
