code optimization

Method Overriding
Method Overriding have 1 class and can have multiple method with same name but with same argumrnt.

Dynamic Binding (Run-Time Polymorphism):
Dynamic binding in Java refers to the process of determining the specific implementation of a method at runtime, based on the actual type of the object being referred to, 
rather than the declared type of the reference variable. It is also known as late binding or runtime polymorphism

Super Keyword and Method Hiding
Super Keyword:
he super keyword is used to refer to the immediate parent class (superclass) of the current class.
It allows you to access members (fields, methods, and constructors) of the superclass that might be hidden or overridden by the subclass.

Method Hiding:
Method hiding occurs when a subclass defines a static method with the same signature (name, return type, and parameter list) as a static method in the superclass.
Unlike method overriding (which applies to instance methods), method hiding doesn't involve dynamic dispatch at runtime
