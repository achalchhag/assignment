Theory:
Defining Methods:
A method in Java is a set of instructions that can be called for execution using the method name

Method Parameters and Return Types:
Method parameters are variables that act as placeholders for the values you want to pass into a method when you call it.

Return Types:
The return type of a method specifies the type of value that the method will return after its execution.

Method Overloading:
Method overloading in Java means having two or more methods (or functions) in a class with the same name and different arguments

Static Methods and Variables:
Static Methods:
a static method is a method that belongs to the class itself, rather than to any instance of the class. This means you can call a static method without creating an object of the class.

Variables:
Variables in Java language are the names used to refer to data stored in the memory
