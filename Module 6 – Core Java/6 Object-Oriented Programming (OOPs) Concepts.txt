Theory:
Basics of OOP: Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, Abstraction
Encapsulation:
Bundling data (variables) and the methods that operate on the data into a single unit (class)
Inheritance 
child class can use the parent class using extend keyword
Polymorphism
one interface and multiple implementation
Abstraction:
to hide sensitive data

Inheritance: Single, Multilevel, Hierarchical
1. single inheritance -- single child nd single parent
2. multiple inheritance -- 1child nd multiple parent
3.multilevel inheritance -- class inheritance of base class nd make a chain
4.hybrid -- combination of any 2 inheritance
5. hierarchical -- multiple child nd single parent

Method Overriding and Dynamic Method Dispatch
Method Overriding:
It has 1 class and have multiple method,The name of the method would be same and also have same argument

Dynamic Method Dispatch:
Dynamic Method Dispatch also known as Runtime Polymorphism, 
is a fundamental concept in Java that enables the determination of which method to execute at runtime, rather than at compile time.
