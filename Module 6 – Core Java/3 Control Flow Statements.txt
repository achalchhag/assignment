Theory:
If-Else Statements
If-else statement helps you to run a specific block of a program if the condition is true or else, it will check other conditions.
It is used to control the flow or to determine the rules in a program.

Switch Case Statements
The switch case in java executes one statement from multiple ones.

Loops (For, While, Do-While)
while loop: A while loop is a control flow statement that allows code to be executed repeatedly based on a given Boolean condition.
The while loop can be thought of as a repeating if statement.

For loop: for loop provides a concise way of writing the loop structure. 
Unlike a while loop, a for statement consumes the initialization, condition and increment/decrement in one line thereby providing a shorter, 
easy to debug structure of looping.

Do while: do while loop is similar to while loop with only difference that it checks for condition after executing the statements.

Break and Continue Keywords
Break :The break statement is used to exit a loop prematurely, regardless of the loop's condition

Continue :The continue statement is used to skip the current iteration of a loop and proceed to the next iteration.
