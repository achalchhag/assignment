Theory:
Defining a Class and Object in Java
Class:
A class is a template or a blueprint that describes the characteristics and behaviors of a particular type of object

Object:
An object is an instance of a class, representing a real-world entity with its own specific state and behavior

Constructors and Overloading
Constructors:
a Constructor is a block of codes similar to the method.It is called when an instance of the class is created. 
At the time of calling the constructor, memory for the object is allocated in the memory

Overloading:
Constructor overloading in Java is the ability to define multiple constructors within a class, each with a different set of parameters. 
This allows you to create objects of the class in different ways, depending on the data you have available at the time of object creation

Object Creation, Accessing Members of the Class
Object Creation:
To create an object in Java, you use the new keyword followed by the class name and optional constructor arguments if the class has a constructor

Accessing Members of the Class:
accessing members of a class (fields and methods) depends on their access modifiers and the relationship between the accessing class and the class containing the member

this Keyword:
the this keyword is a reference variable that refers to the current object
