13. Multithreading
Theory:
Introduction to Threads
A thread is a lightweight, independent unit of execution within a program.
It allows you to perform multiple tasks concurrently, enhancing the performance and responsiveness of your applications.

Creating Threads by Extending Thread Class or Implementing Runnable Interface
Extending the Thread Class:
Create a class that extends the Thread class. This gives your class all the properties and methods of a thread.
Override the run() method. This method contains the code that will be executed by the thread.

Implementing the Runnable Interface:
Create a class that implements the Runnable interface. This interface requires you to implement the run() method.
Implement the run() method. This method contains the code that will be executed by the thread.

Thread Life Cycle
A thread's life cycle encompasses the various states it transitions through from creation to termination. These states are defined in the Thread.State

Synchronization and Inter-thread Communication
A thread's life cycle encompasses the various states it transitions through from creation to termination. These states are defined in the Thread.State
