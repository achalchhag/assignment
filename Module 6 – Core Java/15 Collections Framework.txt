15. Collections Framework
Theory:
Introduction to Collections Framework
The Java Collections Framework is a library of classes and interfaces for working with collections of objects.

List, Set, Map, and Queue Interfaces
List:
Java List interface is a member of the Java Collections Framework.

Set:
A Set is an interface that represents a collection of unique elements. It extends the Collection interface and adds the restriction that duplicate elements are not allowed

Map:
A Map is an interface in the java.util package that represents a collection of key-value pairs, where each key is associated with a single value

Queue:
Queue is an interface available in java. util package and extends java. util. Collection interface.

ArrayList, LinkedList, HashSet, TreeSet, HashMap, TreeMap
Array List:
An ArrayList is a resizable-array implementation of the List interface. It provides a dynamic way to store a collection of objects, unlike a regular array which has a fixed size

LinkedList:
A linked list in Java is a dynamic data structure whose size increases as you add the elements and decreases as you remove the elements from the list.

HashSet:
A HashSet is a collection that implements the Set interface, which means it stores unique elements without any particular order.

TreeSet:
A TreeSet is a collection that implements the NavigableSet interface, which in turn extends the SortedSet interface.

HashMap:
HashMap is a data structure that uses the Map interface and a hash table for storing key-value pairs.

TreeMap:
A TreeMap is a data structure that implements the NavigableMap interface, which in turn extends the SortedMap interface:

Iterators and ListIterators
Iterators:
an Iterator is an interface that allows you to traverse through a collection of objects, such as ArrayList, LinkedList, HashSet, etc.
It provides a way to access each element of the collection sequentially without exposing the underlying implementation details.

ListIterators:
ListIterator is a Java Iterator, which is used to iterate elements one-by-one from a List implemented object.
