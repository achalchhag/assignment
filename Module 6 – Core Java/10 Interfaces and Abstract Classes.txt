10. Interfaces and Abstract Classes
Theory:
Abstract Classes and Methods
abstract class 
-- abstract keyword is used
-- never done initialisation
-- abstract class always depend on normal class
-- normal nd abstract method 

abstract method
-- abstract keyowrd
-- abstraction method only have method have doesnot have a code
-- child class have a responsibilty to write a code of abstract method
-- for abstract method abstract class is necessaary 

Interfaces: Multiple Inheritance in Java
interface -- data hide and support multiple inheritance 
interface keyword is used
never create object
by default all method are abstract
by default all the variable is constant
implements word is used

Implementing Multiple Interfaces
A class can implement multiple interfaces. This means that a single class can inherit behavior from multiple sources, allowing for greater flexibility and code reuse.
