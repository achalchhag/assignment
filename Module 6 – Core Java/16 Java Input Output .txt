16. Java Input/Output (I/O)
Theory:
Streams in Java (InputStream, OutputStream)
InputStream:
Used for reading data from a source, such as a file, network connection, or keyboard.
OutputStream:
Used for writing data to a destination, such as a file, network connection, or console.

Reading and Writing Data Using Streams
Reading and writing data using streams" refers to a method of transferring data between a computer system and a source (like a file, network connection, or device) by processing it in continuous chunks, rather than loading the entire data set into memory at once.
This allows for efficient handling of large data volumes, especially when dealing with files or network streams that might be too big to fit entirely in memory.

Handling File I/O Operations
the process of performing input and output actions on a computer file, such as reading data from a file to be used by a program, or writing data from a program to a file for storage; essentially, it's the mechanism that allows a program to interact with the file system to access and manipulate data within files.
